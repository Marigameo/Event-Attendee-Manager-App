# Event-Attendee-Manager-App
A simple electron app to register event attendee and manage them effectively with quick shortcuts

This is just a simple app similar to a todo type app but this helped me to grasp all the basics of electron.
Learned how to create keyboard custom shortcuts and play with them.

Just clone the repo,have a look at the package.json file

Note : Please take this one as a reference and feel free to alter them as per your need.It's more important what you learn than what we showcase. Happy learning.
